## What I learned <a name="learning"></a>

This was my second project in SwiftUI, and it tested basic SwiftUI functionality: stacks, buttons, images, alerts, asset catalogs, and more. This exercise also illustrated the efficiency of SwiftUI: the entire application (including the styling) is 94 lines of code!
